### Notes and TODOs for SparkR Backend 

- Add a stop backend command. This should be called when the R process exits.
  The Java program doesn't stop right now !
- Handle stderr, stdout of Java program better. We shouldn't probably put them on the shell, 
  but we need some way for users to look at the messages.
- Send back the reply length as the first field in the reply. 
  Enforce somehow that the second field should be the error code. Also we should add support
  to capture exceptions and send them in the reply.

- Consider auto parsing all the arguments to RPCs on the R side
  i.e. take something like list(...) and serialize each argument.
- Consider using reflection on the Java side instead of explicit handlers

Future work
- Can we refactor the serializers to have a more visitor-like pattern ?
  That will enable serializing UDFs etc. from R to Java and back.
  

### To try out the new Spark Context, run something like

```
./install-dev.sh
library(SparkR, lib.loc="./lib")
SparkR:::launchBackend("./pkg/src/target/scala-2.10/sparkr-assembly-0.1.jar",
                       "edu.berkeley.cs.amplab.sparkr.SparkRBackend", "12345")
con <- SparkR:::init("localhost", 12345)
s <- SparkR:::createSparkContext("local", "SparkRJavaExpt", "", 
  c("./pkg/src/target/scala-2.10/sparkr-assembly-0.1.jar"))
# You should be able to go to localhost:4041 and see a SparkRJavaExpt as the app name
```
